## Inspiration

The Coronavirus is an urgent health crisis plaguing the world today. The Virus Tracker created by the Â©Abstract Connoisseurs 2020 was engineered to graphically represent its global spread.

## What it does

Our website informs about prevention methods and the latest news. The virus visualization map plots markers on an interactive Google Map.

## How we built it

We used NodeJS, Webpack and the Google Maps API through Google Cloud Console to deploy a static web app to firebase.

## Challenges we ran into

- Slow Internet
- Convoluted documentation
- Parsing live data

## What's next for Coronavirus-io

- Heatmap representation
- Demographic information
- Spread of virus (AI simulation)
- UI options
